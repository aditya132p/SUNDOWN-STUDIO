# Sundown Studio Clone Website with Animation

Welcome to the Sundown Studio Clone project! This open-source project aims to replicate the captivating website animation of [sundown-studio.com](https://www.sundown-studio.com/) using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The animation effects are based on GSAP (GreenSock Animation Platform) and Locomotive Scroll, among other libraries.

## About

Whether you're passionate about web development, animation, or open-source collaboration, there's a place for you in this project.
